# Protocol Research and Notes

This file contains various protocol research documents, beyond the documentation provided in the white paper and technical paper, that are used to help guide open-source contributors to Adamnite. These include documents that describe the key generation process, peer to peer network, and the reputation system used in Adamnite's consensus protocol.


The Design Docs describe various data structures, such as accounts and blocks. 

The Historical Directory, as the name suggests, is included for historical reference, and describes early notes from Adamnite's open source contributors before the protocol was formalized. 

The Protocol Research Directory includes relatively up to date specifications, notes, and discussions from Adamnite's core developers, who are currently maintaining the core goAdamnite protocol. 

Individual client implementators and maintainers are encouraged to check this repository, along with the specifications directory, every quarter for documented changes. Daily, weekly, or monthly changes will be recorded in the various communication channels on Discord or documented in the technical paper.
