# Protocol Research

This file contains various protocol research documents, beyond the documentation provided in the white paper and technical paper, that are used to help guide open-source contributors to Adamnite. These include documents that describe the key generation process, peer to peer network, and the reputation system used in Adamnite's consensus protocol.


The Design Docs describe various data structures, such as accounts and blocks. Different directories for protocol research (ie protocol research 1, protocol research 2) describe different moments in Adamnite's history.
