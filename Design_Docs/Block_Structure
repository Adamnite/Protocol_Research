#This file documents the basic block structure of an Adamnite Block. 

Block{
 Previous Hash: "The hash of the previous block",
 Hash: "The hash of the current block",
 Timestamp: "The timestamp at which the block was approved",
 Proposer: "The public address of the validator/witness that proposed the block",
 Net Fee: "The total amount of transaction fees for the current 
 Witness List: "A list of the current witnesses chosen for the current block, from the net witness pool", 
 Transaction List: "A list of all the transactions in the current block",
 Storage Size: "The net size, in bytes, of all the messages in the transactions for this block",
 Block Number: "The block number of the current block",
 Size: "The overall size in bytes of the block"
 Transaction Root: "The root of the merkle tree in which transactions for this block are stored",
 Sides: "Sides are essentially a list of orphan/uncle blocks for the current block: they are valid blocks that were proposed at the same time but were not approved."
 Signature: "The block signature that validates the block was created by right validator"
}

The first 10 variables (excluding sides) are all part of the block header. Regarding sides, an algorithm can be used to determine the winning block. When two valid
blocks are proposed at the same time, the one that was proposed by a validator with a higher average score (votes_for + reputation * n, where votes_for is the total 
number of votes the validator received during the most recent voting session, reputation is their reputation score as determined by RepuStake, and n is an arbitary number
determined by the total number of particiapants in the network).
