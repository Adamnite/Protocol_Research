//This document outlines a  basic ToDo List for the first proof of concept (POC) for the Adamnite Protocol. 

1. Cryptographic Primitives for Signature Generation and Account Hashing. This can be implemented in the Crypto folder in the GoAdamnite Repository. A lot of this 
   can be implementations of Go Cryptographic Libaries; the crypto primitives should be used as a package throughout the rest of the implementation.
   
2. Account Generation, within the context of the P2P protocol. This can be restricted to simple testing, but the witness nodes and the regular full nodes should be finalized. 

3. //Extremely Important! Serialization, encoding, and data manipulation for addresses, data types, transactions, and blocks. This is sternous, but not extremely difficult.
   Implementation can be based on RLP, an exisiting prootcol, and or creating our own separate implementation.
   
4. DPOS Protocol. Transactions should be submitted to the P2P network, be organized into blocks, and then be approved by validators. Validators should be chosen in a democratic
   manner, with votes occuring through the P2P network. Reputation can be incorporated through a simple mechanism as described in RepuStake: Witness Nodes with a lower reputation 
   will have a lower chance of being picked to valdiate a block, even if they have more votes.
