## Protocol Research
This directory contains various documents that helped guide the development of the first POC for the Adamnite Protocol. Examples include a broad protocol implementation document,
documentation for a P2P example put together by some of the developers, and some roadmap planning that might be good to get a better understanding of the protocol.
